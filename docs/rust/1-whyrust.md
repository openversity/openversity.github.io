## Why is Rust?
* _**Faster**_

* _**Safe**_

* _**Productive**_

---
### Performance
* Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient:
    * No Runtime; No garbage collector; No explicte `free`

    * It can power performance-critical services

    * It can run on embedded devices

    * Compiled to executable binrary

    * LLVM backend and optimizations 

    * Competitive with C/C++ in speed

---
### Reliability
* Rust has Sophisticated and Rich Type system

* Ownership model guarantees memory/thread safety

* Safe abstractions and rules of concurrency

* Eliminate bugs at compile time
    * No segfaults

    * No null pointers

    * No dangling pointers

    * No race conditions with safe concurrency

---
### Productivity
* Faster development

* Rust has great documentation

* Rich Tooling and help

* Integrated package mananger

* Multi-editor support

---
## Who can use Rust?
* Rust is using Rust
    * 92% in Rust; Remaining is in C, Shell and other

* Rust can be used to develop applications for
    * Commandline

    * WebAssembly

    * Networking 

    * Embedded

---
## Summary
* C/C++ has more control but less safety
* Python has less control with more safety
* Java is in the middle
* Golang has more control but has some performance penalty due to GC

> **_Rust has more control plus more safety_**
* Rust can be used with speed and stability
    * Development speeds
    * Application performace and reliability
