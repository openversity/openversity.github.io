## Agenda
* **Variables & Constants**

* **Data Types: Scalar & Compound**

* **Functions**

* **Comments**

* **Control Flow**

---

## Variables and Mutability
* Variables are immutable by default, one of the safety that Rust offers while we write concurrent code; Following code in line 4 will not compile
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let x = 5;
        println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
        x = 6;
        println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    }
    ```
* Variables are declared using `let`
* Mutable variables are declared using additional keyword `mut`; So following code will work
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let mut x = 5;
        println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
        x = 6;
        println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    }
    ```
---
## Variables and Constants
Then what is the difference between an immutable variable and a constant
* A constant is declared using `const` and must always be annotated with the data type
    ```rust
    const PI: f32 = 3.141;
    ```
* PI is a float constant and is always immutable.
* Unlike a variable rust constants can NOT be re-bound to another value.
* Constant can be declared in any **scope** including the global scope.
* Constants live thru the entire time the program runs.
* Constant can be only set to a constant expression which can be evaluated at compile time.
 
_Note: Constants names are in uppercase in rust by convention._

---
## Variable Shadowing
Same variable name can be redeclared with in the scope with different value; I will shadow the previous value
* Following code is valid and compiles unlike C and C++ where a variable cannot be re-declared in the scope
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let token_number = "100";
        let token_number = 101;
        let token_number = token_number + 1;
        println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    }
    ```
* Every time we use `let` with same name we are shadowing the previous value and data type; 
* It will be useful when the value needs to be transformed to a different data type like the case above; we need not have to declare two variables like `str_token_number` and `token_number`

---
## Data Types
* Rust is a statically typed language; Variables must be declared at compile time with data type
* Data type can be inferred at compile time with the help of assigned value
    ```rust
    let token_number = "100"; //Inferred type as strinng
    let token_number:u32 = token_number.parse().expect("Not a number");
    ```
* Rust has 4 scalar types
  * integer
  * float
  * Boolean
  * Characters

---
## Scalar Types - Integers
**List of signed and unsigned integers with explicit size; `u` refers to unsigned variants**

  Type   |  List of integers types                           
--------:|----------------------------------
Signed  :| `i8, i16, i32, i64, i128, isize` 
Unsigned:| `u8, u16, u32, u64, u128, usize` 

> `isize` or `usize` refers to arch specific integer size; i.e. i32 in 32-bit and i64 in 64-bit cpu architecture

**Integer literals**
```rust
let num_dec = 98_222;     //decimal
let num_hex = 0xff;       //hex
let num_oct = 0o77;       //octal
let num_bin = 0b1101;     //binary; rust also supports binary literal
let num_byte:u8 = b`A`    //u8 only bytes
```

**Integer Overflow**
* Debug builds will panic the program in case of integer overflow due to the extra runtime checks added by rust.

* Release builds(`--release`) perform wrapping in case of overflows; For example, storing 256 in u8 integer will wrap around to 0, and 257 will wrap around to 1.

---
## Scalar Types - Floats
**Rust has two floating point types**

* `f32` : for single precision float
* `f64` : for double precision float
Example:
```rust
let one_fourth = 0.25; // f64 by default
let three_fourth: f32 = 0.75; // we need to specify explicitely for f32 
```

_Default float type in rust is_: `f64`

---
## Scalar Types - Booleans and Characters
**Boolean Type: `bool`**
* `bool` type is one byte size
* `true` and `false` are boolean literals
```rust
let is_signaled = false; //default
let is_shutdown: bool = true; // explicit type annotation
```
* All control-flow expressions in rust should result into boolean value

**Character type: `char`**
* Rust `char` type is unicode scalar type and 4 bytes in size
* It can store unicode scalar values ranging from `U+0000` to `U+D7FF` and `U+E000` to `U+10FFFF` inclusive
* `char` literals are specified using single quotes
```rust
let c = 'A';
let z = 'â„¤';
```

---
## Compound Types - Tuple
* A tuple is a group of related values; values can be of different types
* Tuple is fixed in length and cannot grow or shrink once created
    ```rust
    let readings_today: (i32, f64, bool) = (25, 65.5, false); 
    ```
* Variable `readings_today` is a tuple that represents 3 values
* Values can be accessed using **_destructuring_**
    ```rust
    let (temp, wind, is_rain) = readings_today;
    println!("Temprature today:{}" temp);
    ```

* Values can also be accessed using member index
    ```rust
    let (temp, wind, is_rain) = readings_today;
    println!("Temprature today:{}", readings_today.0);
    println!("Wind speed today:{}", readings_today.1);
    ```

---
## Compound Types - Arrays
* Array is a fixed size collection of values of similar type
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let days = ["sun", "mon", "tue", "wed", "thu", "fri", "sat"];
        let values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7];
    }
    ```
* Array is a single chunk of memory on stack
* Elements are accessed using index
    ```rust
    let first  = values[0];
    let second = values[1];
    let last   = values[6];
    ```

* Rust protects from accessing array elements out of bounds and will panic immediately if index is out of range.

* Arrays can not grow in size; We can use standard library collection `Vector` which is allocated on heap and can grow and shrink in size 

---
## Functions
* Functions are defined in rust using keyword `fn`
* `fn main()` is the entry point of a rust program
* functions can be defined any where in the program
* function body block has statements and expressions
* return type is specified using arrow **`->`**
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let x = 6;
        let y = 4;
        println!("Sum of {} and {}  = {}", x, ,y, sum(x,y));
    }

    //Function returns 32-bit integer
    fn sum(x: i32, y:i32) -> i32 {
        x + y
    }
    ```
* Function return value is implicite with last expression without semi colon;
* In rust, a block itself can be an expression if it has an expression at the end without semicolan
* So the following statement is valid in rust
    ```rust
    let avg = {
        let sum = 700;
        let count = 7; 
        sum / count
    }
    ```

* To return early from the function we can use explicite `return`

---
## Control Flow
**Branching with `if`** 
* if condition must always be a boolean expression; rust does not convert other types to boolean
    ```rust
    if n % 2 == 0 {
        println!("{} is an even number", n);
    } else {
        println!("{} is an odd number", n)
    }
    ```
* similar to other languages, we can chain with multiple `else if` blocks
* if blocks can also be an expression and can be assinged to a variable
    ```rust
    let days = if year % 100 == 0 {365} else {366} 
    println!("Year:{} has Days:{}", year, days);
    ```

**Branching with `match`**
* Branching with `match` is more powerful than with multiple if blocks


**Repetion with `loop`**
* loop {}

**Repetion with `while`**
* while condition {}

**Repetion with `for`**
* for var in list {}

---
## Summary
* Rust is statically typed language
